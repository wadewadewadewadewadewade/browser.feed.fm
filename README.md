This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I spun this up just to look at the endpoint I created to look at Widgets-by-tag data. It's pretty ugly

To use this just run `npm start` and then use localhost:3000 to try looking at the dummy data I slugged into a sample database.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

I didn't write any tests

### `npm run build`

...nor have I tried to build
